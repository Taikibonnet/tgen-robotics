# TGen Robotics Brand Guidelines

## Brand Name
- Full name: TGen Robotics
- Acceptable shortened version: TGen

## Logo Usage

### Standard Logo
The standard logo features a minimalist design with a T that envelops the "GEN" lettering. This version is suitable for formal communications, official documents, and situations where clarity is paramount.

### Script Logo
The script logo offers a more dynamic, fluid interpretation of the TGen brand. This version works well for creative applications, digital media, and contexts where a more approachable brand presence is desired.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- Cyan Blue: #0cebeb
- Turquoise Green: #20e3b2

The logos use a gradient transitioning between these two colors, symbolizing innovation, technology, and forward thinking.

### Usage
- Always maintain the gradient direction as shown in the logo files
- When a single color is needed, use #0cebeb (the cyan blue)
- For dark backgrounds, the full-color logos with glow effect are preferred

## Typography

- Logo text: Arial Bold
- "ROBOTICS" text: Arial Bold, letter-spaced
- Corporate communications: Arial family is recommended for consistency

## Clear Space

Always maintain adequate clear space around the logo - at minimum, the height of the "ROBOTICS" text in the logo.

## Inappropriate Uses

- Do not distort or stretch the logos
- Do not change the color scheme
- Do not remove elements from the logos
- Do not use the logos on visually cluttered backgrounds that reduce legibility
